Hello! I'm Gabriel, I'm 18 years old --
I am very interested in becoming a great successful programmer and having the opportunity to join a great company --
I am currently taking a course on C#, to learn and be able to perform various functions 
However, I intend to expand my knowledge and enter other areas, such as Java, HTML, python and many others
